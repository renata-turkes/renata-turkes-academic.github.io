During my PhD at the [University of Antwerp Operations Research (ANT/OR)](https://antor.uantwerpen.be/) group, I supervised a few courses and theses:
- <em>Mathematical models and solutions for container stowage problems</em>, Kiros Gebrearegawi Kebedow, Hawassa University, 2019. I served as a member of Kiros's PhD dissertation committee. 
- <em>Matching pupils to schools: Analysis of the Antwerp matching algorithm, Jonas Dierckxsens, University of Antwerp, 2017/2108. I supervised Jonas's work, which was nominated for the Belgian Operational Research Society award as the best master thesis in operations research.
- <em>Corporate social responsibility</em>, University of Antwerp, 2014-2018. I supervised a number of team projects wherein students develop solutions for non-profit and social-profit organisations that cannot afford expensive consulting services. 
- <em>Applied mathematics</em>, University of Antwerp, 2014-16. I was a tutor for the lab sessions, wherein students learned to use MATLAB to solve complex problems in a variety of application domains.

Before that, I worked at the [University of Tuzla, Deparment of Mathematics](http://pmf.untz.ba/odsjeci/matematika/) as a teaching assistant in 2009/10 and 2013/14, where I prepared and conducted the exercise and exam sessions for the following courses: Functional analysis, Set theory, Probability theory, Statistics, Numerical analysis, Introduction to mathematics, Popular mathematics at the Faculty of Science; Mathematics I and Mathematics II at the Faculty of Technology; Mathematics II at the Faculty of Civil Engineering; and Mathematics for economists at the Faculty of Economics.

An old website with course notes, exam sessions and tips while working at the University of Tuzla can be found [here](https://renataturkes.wixsite.com/renata-turkes). My workbooks with detailed solutions (in Bosnian language) are available for the following courses:
- [Set theory](https://132467e1-5067-00f7-b135-ff7a5eeb0509.filesusr.com/ugd/eb99bb_559d75cc8655435a877855e400c0f2f5.pdf)
