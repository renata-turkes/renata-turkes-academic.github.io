Hi and welcome to my page! 

My main research interests lie in the domain of topological data analysis. In 2024 I joined as a post-doc at [Inria](https://inria.fr/en)'s [DataShape](https://team.inria.fr/datashape/) team.

I obtained a PhD in topological data analysis, and a PhD in operations research, at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/), under the supervision of respectively Professor [Steven Latré](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/steven-latre/) and Professor [Kenneth Sörensen](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/kenneth-sorensen/), following a a Msc in Pure Mathematics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), and a BSc in Mathematics from the [University of Tuzla](http://www.untz.ba/index.php?page=home).

From September 2021 to June 2022 I worked with [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/) and [Nina Otter](https://www.ninaotter.com) as a Fulbright visiting scholar at the [UCLA Department of Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Besides mathematics, I care about feminist, queer and anti-racist work, and love to hang out with my dog, travel, read and discuss [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110993062-renata), see art, play (table-)tennis or floatfit. Most of all, in the last years, I spend a lot of time playing and thinking about [roller derby](https://antwerprollerderby.be/).
