During my PhD at the University of Antwerp Operations Research group ANT/OR, I supervised a few courses and theses:
- 2019: Jury member for a PhD thesis by Kiros Gebrearegawi Kebedow, Mathematical models and solutions for container stowage problems, Hawassa University.
- 2017-2108: Supervision of a masterâ€™s thesis by Jonas Dierckxsens, Matching pupils to schools: Analysis of the Antwerp matching algorithm, University of Antwerp (nominated for the Belgian
Operational Research Society award as the best master thesis in operations research).
- 2014-2018: Supervision of a number of team projects for Corporate social responsibility course at the University of Antwerp, which sees students develop solutions for non-profit and social-profit
organisations that cannot afford expensive consulting services.
- 2014-16: Tutor for lab sessions for Applied mathematics course (MATLAB to solve complex problems in a variety of applications)

Before that, I worked at the University of Tuzla as a teaching assistant in 2009/10 and 2013/14, where I prepared and conducted the exercise and exam sessions for the following
courses: Functional analysis, Set theory, Probability theory, Statistics, Numerical analysis, Introduction to mathematics, Popular mathematics at the Faculty of Science; Mathematics I and Mathematics II
at the Faculty of Technology; Mathematics II at the Faculty of Civil Engineering; and Mathematics for economists at the Faculty of Economics. An old website with course notes, exam sessions and tips can be found [here](https://renataturkes.wixsite.com/renata-turkes).

Some of the workbooks with complete solutions (in Bosnian language):
